  PortfolioGrid
</h1>

PortfolioGrid is a one-page portfolio template for web design and web development freelancers. It uses Gatsby along with Bootstrap and Redux for its unique layout.

## :bookmark_tabs: Technologies Used

1.  **HTML5, CSS3**

    This template makes use of HTML5 semantic elements and custom CSS3 to style change the standard Bootstrap classes. There is minimal custom CSS used to give it a true Bootstrap flatUI feel.

2.  **Bootstrap**

    Bootstrap was used to style all sections of the template and can therefore be easily modified with additional Bootstrap classes.

3.  **React + Gatsby + Redux**

    Gatsby was used as the static page generator for this single-page template. This was done to take advantage of React components for development. Another advantage was using gatsby-image to automatically generate images based on screen size. Redux was used to manage the state due to the 5 separate accordion style menus.
